> **Default flow:** `keyseal add` scaffolds and encrypts a new secret document immediately, without writing plaintext starter content to the final `.enc.yaml` path.

Keyseal is a small Go CLI that standardizes encrypted file workflows around `sops`, `age`, and Git. It was built to solve a real production problem: managing Git-backed SOPS secret workflows at scale.

It helps teams:

- keep encrypted secret files in a repository
- scaffold new secret documents
- open encrypted files in `sops`
- inspect Git status, diffs, and file history by logical name
- commit and roll back Keyseal-managed changes without staging the whole repo
- render decrypted values into runtime formats
- run commands with decrypted environment variables injected
- validate repository layout and config health
- enforce strict CI verification before release or deployment

Keyseal does not implement encryption itself, replace SOPS, run a server, expose an API, or behave like a hosted secrets platform.

Keyseal uses the official SOPS Go decrypt library for read-only decryption in render, exec, and validation paths. The external SOPS binary is still required for commands that create, edit, or rotate encrypted files.

## Why it exists

SOPS already solves encryption and editing well. Keyseal stays one layer above that and makes a repo-backed workflow more predictable:

- consistent file naming and layout
- Git-aware workflows around the encrypted files that already live in the repo
- small config with strong defaults
- repeatable render and exec flows
- clear validation for common mistakes

## Requirements

- Go 1.27+ to build the CLI
- age recipients configured in `.sops.yaml`

Developer/admin machines that run `keyseal add`, `keyseal edit`, or `keyseal updatekeys` also need the external `sops` binary.

Production, CI, or deploy machines that only run `keyseal render`, `keyseal exec`, `keyseal doctor`, or `keyseal verify` need only:

- the `keyseal` binary
- the encrypted secrets files/repo
- age private key material, usually through `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` or `sops.age_key_file`

They do not need the external `sops` binary or the external `age` binary. Servers need the age key, not the age CLI.

## Installation

Pre-built binaries and Linux packages are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jrpbuilds/keyseal/releases) page. Each release includes tar.gz archives (Linux and macOS, amd64 and arm64), `.deb` and `.rpm` packages (Linux amd64 and arm64), and SHA256 checksums.

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
sudo dpkg -i keyseal_<version>_amd64.deb
```

**Linux (RHEL/Fedora/SUSE):**

```bash
sudo rpm -i keyseal-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm
```

**Other platforms:** extract the binary from the appropriate tar.gz archive and place it somewhere in your `PATH`.

## Quick start

```bash
make build
./bin/keyseal init
./bin/keyseal add production/platform/app --template laravel
./bin/keyseal edit production/platform/app
./bin/keyseal status
./bin/keyseal commit -m "Add production app secret"
./bin/keyseal render production/platform/app --stdout
./bin/keyseal doctor
```

For a fuller walkthrough, see the [Quick Start](https://github.com/jrpbuilds/keyseal/wiki/Quick-Start) guide and the [wiki](https://github.com/jrpbuilds/keyseal/wiki).

## Build

```bash
make tidy
make check
make build
./bin/keyseal --version
./bin/keyseal --help
```

## Command overview

- `keyseal init` bootstraps a repository layout, `keyseal.yaml`, and `.sops.yaml`
- `keyseal add <logical-name>` creates and encrypts a starter env secret document, with optional immediate Git commit support
- `keyseal edit <logical-name>` opens the target file with `sops`, bootstrapping empty placeholder files first when needed
- `keyseal updatekeys [logical-name...]` syncs SOPS recipients from `.sops.yaml`, with optional explicit Git commit support
- `keyseal status [logical-name]` shows Git status for Keyseal-managed files
- `keyseal diff <logical-name>` shows `git diff` for one secret file
- `keyseal history <logical-name>` shows file-scoped Git history for one secret file
- `keyseal commit` stages current Keyseal-managed changes and creates a Git commit
- `keyseal rollback <logical-name> --to <commit>` restores one secret file from Git history
- `keyseal render <logical-name...>` decrypts, merges, and renders secret values, skipping empty placeholder files
- `keyseal exec <logical-name...> -- <command...>` runs a child process with merged env vars
- `keyseal doctor` validates config sanity, SOPS CLI availability, age key/deployment context, `.sops.yaml` readiness, and common mistakes
- `keyseal verify` runs strict CI checks and fails on any doctor warning or failure
- `keyseal version` reports version, commit, and build date metadata

## What Keyseal is not

- not a crypto implementation
- not a Vault replacement
- not a secret hosting service
- not a daemon or web UI
- not a Kubernetes controller

## Usage

```bash
keyseal add production/platform/app --template laravel
keyseal edit production/platform/app
keyseal updatekeys production/platform/app --yes
keyseal status production/platform/app
keyseal history production/platform/app --oneline
keyseal commit -m "Update production app secret"
keyseal render production/platform/app --stdout --format json
keyseal render --profile production
keyseal render --profile production --dry-run
keyseal exec production/platform/app -- php artisan migrate
keyseal rollback production/platform/app --to <commit> --dry-run
keyseal doctor
keyseal verify
```

Key workflow details:

- `-m, --message` implies commit on mutating commands
- `git.auto_commit` is off by default
- `sops.age_key_file` is used as the default age key path unless `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` is already set
- read-only decrypt paths use the SOPS Go library and do not require external `sops` or `age` binaries
- mutating commands check the configured `sops.binary` before creating, editing, or rotating encrypted files
- `updatekeys` uses `.sops.yaml` as the recipient source of truth and does not rotate secret values or data encryption keys
- `keyseal commit` stages only Keyseal-managed files, not the whole repo
- `rollback` restores the encrypted file from Git history; `--dry-run` previews safely
- `profiles` in `keyseal.yaml` group render definitions; all profiles are validated on every config load, so a malformed profile blocks any command until fixed
- `render --profile --dry-run` decrypts and fully validates inputs (age key material required) but writes nothing and prints only the plan

For exact command behavior and more examples, see the [Command Reference](https://github.com/jrpbuilds/keyseal/wiki/Command-Reference), [Configuration Reference](https://github.com/jrpbuilds/keyseal/wiki/Configuration-Reference), and [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/jrpbuilds/keyseal/wiki/Troubleshooting) wiki pages.

## Version reporting

```bash
keyseal --version
keyseal version
keyseal version --short
```

Release builds stamp version, commit, and build date metadata via Go linker flags. Local builds default to `dev`, `unknown`, and `unknown` unless you pass `VERSION`, `COMMIT`, and `DATE`. When Git metadata is available, local builds use the latest `v*` tag and the short current commit.

## Release artifacts

```bash
make dist VERSION=v1.0.0 COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
```

`make dist` builds tar.gz archives, `.deb` and `.rpm` packages for Linux (amd64, arm64), and a single SHA256 checksums file covering all artifacts to `dist/`. Linux packages require [nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/install/) to be installed.

## Development

```bash
make fmt
make check
make test
make build
```

## Origin

Keyseal was born out of a real production need: managing encrypted secret files safely and predictably with SOPS-compatible encryption, age keys, and Git. It is a small, focused tool for teams that want Git-backed secret workflows without the overhead of a hosted platform.
